# Music-Recommendation-App


This a personnal project for the ALX SE curriculum, I have built a music web-app. This app servers music recommendations to users based off their "liked" songs. It contains a machine learning algorithm that recommend music suggestions according to the kind or genre of music the user prefers.

It puts songs into categories and only suggests song from yhe catergory the user listens to the most.
JMusic app is simple to navigate and straight forward like a regular music app, with a user-friendly client side where users can browse through their favorite songs.
